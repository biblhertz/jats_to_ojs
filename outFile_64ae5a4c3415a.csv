                        , create a rather comprehensive image of
                    Italy. In this paper, I show that the Cotton Roll XIII.44 of the British Library
                    is put together from two maps of different scale: one for Italy north of Rome
                    and a smaller scale for southern Italy. It displays more than 1200 toponyms and
                    six-thousand kilometres of rivers. The second map, Ms.1816 of the University of
                    Strasbourg, is almost identical to the northern part in content. Devoid of
                    political boundaries, there is no orography and an unusual flat hierarchy of
                    icons. Despite large differences in appearance, they share a common data base.
                    Both derive probably from a lost master chart. Despite necessary overlap,
                    Biondo's regional inventories differ substantially. He may have seen these maps
                    but he did not rely on them.",Galley file,kurt.guckelsberger@gmx.de,galley_file.pdf,test;testing;chriss,cover_image.png,a really interesting article
