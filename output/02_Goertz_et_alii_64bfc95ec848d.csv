Abstract,"Bibliotheca Hertziana's project """" ( ) aims at a cognitive-semantic analysis of Flavio
                    Biondo's ""Italia Illustrata"" (1474) linking with contemporary maps. At focus are
                    relations between historical maps and texts aiming to explore the historical
                    understanding of space and the knowledge associated with it. Our research
                    combines cognitive-semantic parameters such as toponyms, landmarks, spatial
                    frames of reference, geometric relations, gestalt principles and different
                    perspectives with computational linguistic analysis. Contributing to Spatial
                    Humanities, we are convinced that all maps are cognitive maps, depicting
                    culture-specific spatial knowledge and practices. This chapter focuses on data
                    modelling comprising all research data generated within the project, their
                    storage and access as well as their publication as Linked Open Data in the
                    Semantic Web. Recogito is being used as the main tool for static annotations of
                    places and persons/peoples in text and maps. These are complemented by
                    cognitive-linguistic spatial role markups by means of the BRAT tool. To achieve
                    a deeper and more generic semantic level of linguistic and map-related
                    annotations, we pursue the transition to an ontology-based representation. For
                    this purpose, we defined a domain ontology based on the event-based CIDOC
                    Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) and its spatiotemporal extension CRMgeo in
                    OWL-DL, and appropriate mappings to be applied to the annotations exported in
                    CSV, RDF and JSON formats. Using the CRM opens up a wide spectrum of
                    interoperability and linking to many web resources, such as the gazetteers being
                    used with Recogito. For ontological enrichment and processing of the primary
                    data, we use the Virtual Research Environment WissKI with CRM as the top
                    conceptual model. This allows for a semantic interpretation of annotations such
                    that, e.g., for each place, we generate an instantiated CRM description in
                    triple format, ready for storage and publication as Linked Data. In the same
                    fashion, mappings are applied to the results of spatial role labeling - these
                    triples encode cognitive parameters, primarily  constructions."
