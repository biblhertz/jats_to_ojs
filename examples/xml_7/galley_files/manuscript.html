                  <p class="grid">Contemporary cartography faces numerous challenges to
                     adequately account how a hodological description, here Biondo’s <i>Italia
                        Illustrata</i> (1474) could be imagined in the form of a topographical
                     map, based on consistent spatial dimensions, but some challenges call for our
                     attention. After centuries of refinement the topographic map may now provide a
                     cultural representation of geography ubiquitously deployed in the humanities and
                     sciences. It has become even second nature for many fields of science and
                     scholarship, although we should admit we lack full comprehension of maps
                     influence on our understanding. This chapter takes up this matter from the
                     perspective of semiotics and contemporary critical cartography studies related
                     to the comprehending the construction and meaning of territory made through and
                     with maps. Taking what we know from the sociology of science about the ambiguity
                     of knowledge representations, it seems highly relevant to commence by broadening
                     the scope of considerations through semiotics to examine maps’ representations
                     of geographical, cultural memory as institutionalized mnemonic devices that
                     distill complex meanings into symbolic representations. Following Umberto Eco’s
                     model of communication, these stabilize cultural and political associations of
                     places both explicitly and implicitly and sustain themselves through the
                     performances of creating and reading their cartographic presentations. The
                     chapter closes with broader considerations of these challenges and potentials
                     regarding maps analyzed in humanities research that considers the cultural
                     constitution of mappable knowledge.</p>

            <p id="jyhs52tq13nr">This contribution to the workshop on Flavio Biondo’s <i>Italia
                  Illustrata</i> sets out to take up workshop themes – spatial knowledge, its
               contextualization, and spatial representation – and connect them to research in the
               fields of cartography and GIScience. Considering a work created during an early
               phase in the development of modern mapmaking opens fresh perspectives and allows us
               to reconsider assumptions about mapping. As we read the document of Biondo’s
               geographical description, we find ourselves leaving the certitude and exactitude of
               contemporary geoscience representations behind and begin to reflect on explicit as
               well as implicit issues and ideological claims. We are made to consider modernity’s
               so-called ‘cartographic gaze’, which has over the centuries become second nature for
               most makers and users of maps, including in the sciences and humanities. Following
               Kant’s epistemological critique and its methods advanced by semioticians, a semiotic
               study of a geographical text or cartographic presentations is able to probe these
               issues more thoroughly. An ensuing synthesis can consider these issues
               dialectically, as well as the underlying hidden issues that a semiotic approach
               helps reveal.</p>
            <p id="evc60h49fljb">The various matters of geographical description involve
               geographical representation and knowledge and cut to the core of epistemological
               issues of societal power related to maps and meaning. The connection of a narrative
               trope to a particular map also needs to take up scholarly discussions about
               uncertainty and ambiguity in the context of an ideological framing of mapping
               praxis. In this chapter, I will approach these three issues through materials from
               <i>Italia Illustrata</i> presented at the workshop. The grounding
               assertion is that the semiotic analysis that considers historical conditions can
               explain how Biondo’s discourses constitute their validity and their value of truth
               for that era – through the creation of his textual geographic descriptions. Based
               on
               this critical assessment, we can reconstruct the reception of Biondo’s text as a
               memory device. Finally, we can examine Biondo’s constructions of meaning in light
               of
               our knowledge of their geographical relevance for his contemporary peers. Our own
               contemporary concerns with uncertainty in geocentric and egocentric mapping,
               especially regarding functionalist and ideological critique modes, can shed light
               Biondo’s socio-political connotations, as well as those of his contemporaries, as
               grounded in ancient geographies, which form the foundation of his illustrations and
               are precursors of modern geography’s striving for representational certitude.<a href="#u5ihwnxnnvqc">1</a></p>
            <p id="opejm6zxg5">Given the breadth of the issues and reliance on concepts from
               multiple fields, some terms require preliminary definition.</p>
            <p id="f526qmxndtdp">Maps are resources for graphically communicating complex
               geographical relations. They can be used alone or with other media to develop a
               richer understanding of these relations in terms of regions, places, topography,
               settlements, or other geographically distributed phenomena and to support any
               intervention in the interactions between such phenomena. They are not merely images
               that illustrate, because they rely on specific cultural and institutionalized
               constellations of graphic elements, tropes, and narratives to support the
               communication of geographical relations.</p>
            <p id="nmascazi43ls">The ‘cartographic gaze’ has many meanings. In terms of contemporary
               human geography, it applies to the study of spatial societal and environmental
               relations in the context of their cultural, political, economic, and social
               significance.<a href="#f4vu2g985sys">2</a> A concept arising
               in art historical scholarship of the 20th century,<a href="#cs69euh17tz">3</a> the cartographic gaze relates to concepts of the
               scopic regime<a href="#a5wfh3ewoigs">4</a> and involves culturally
               manifest tropes of seeing and controlling the body and its use as metaphor for the
               political entity associated with territory.<a href="#zfwcoxmfkvuu">5</a></p>
            <p id="lkepifw1gohf">As far as the construction and reading of maps are concerned, “to
               illustrate” means (beyond the general definitions of the word) to explain, to
               clarify, and to add insight geographically (see also Laureys in this volume). The
               English word derives from the Latin <i>illustrare</i>, meaning to add
               light or brightness to something. Biondo’s use of the adjective form in his title
               suggests the importance of selection and highlighting in contrast to a process of
               engaging with the subject, which modern cartographers would wholeheartedly embrace
               while struggling to explain precisely what and how the selection is used
               methodically to elucidate cartographic communication.</p>
            <p id="uqemmqjsmqf">These difficulties go hand in hand with the uncertainty that arises
               from the epistemological separation of knowledge in our minds as distinct from our
               experience in the world. In contemporary science, especially in physical and
               environmental sciences, the concept of uncertainty narrowly articulates possible
               differences between an actual situation and the data recorded to describe that
               situation.<a href="#bu9xsga5a6g">6</a> In interdisciplinary
               contexts, uncertainty provides emphasis for different professionally and
               scientifically sound approaches to mediate philosophical and scientific differences
               in specific cultural and institutional contexts involving a creator/writer and a
               reader.<a href="#fn7">7</a></p>
            <p id="zxiuasvouhr">In the context of these definitions, the maps known to us can
               perhaps best be understood as the products of a graphic technology to reduce spatial
               ambiguity or provide geographical insights, which corresponds in significant ways
               –
               despite our visuality – to Biondo’s hodological representations in <i>Italia
                  Illustrata</i>. Institutions play a vital part in map production, not just
               by providing funds to support the complex work of creating maps, but also by
               co-developing and facilitating the frameworks required to understand these maps. As
               Alfred Korzybski puts it, the two important characteristics of maps are:</p>
            <div class="blockquote"><a id="d6e127"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="first" id="oakxonnopepf">A map is not the territory it represents, but if correct, it
                  has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its
                  usefulness.<a href="#fn8">8</a></p>
            </div>
            <p id="ttuwzid5d3y">In other words, maps are not linear texts consisting of words and
               grammar or comparable graphic elements, nor, due to their graphic nature and
               cartographical fidelity, can they be reduced to the purely textual. Texts that
               describe geographical places and spaces and maps that visualize geographical places
               and spaces are fundamentally both <i>models</i>, finite constructions that
               can be inconsistent, but still useful when drawn or read with a specific purpose or
               purposes in mind.<a href="#fn9">9</a> In this sense, communication
               with geographical description in either map or textual form involves the creation
               of
               inferences in one context and the (often broad) interpretation of inferences in
               another context. Creator/author and reader require a level of competency to assure
               that ambiguity of signification in the communication is channeled or minimized. The
               creator generates a strategy, which, following Umberto Eco’s pragmatic approach,
               calls for the reader’s cooperation in making a series of interpretative choices from
               a set of multiple possibilities.<a href="#rgcaieo1qnxo">10</a> As
               such, generating and attempting communication involve activity on the part of both
               creator and reader.</p>
            <p id="n0iz609somzk6">In his work <i>A Theory of Semiotics</i>, Eco examines
               the limits of the widespread contemporary syntactical and linear model of
               communication and proposes a semantic-pragmatic process and hermeneutical approach
               to understanding text that accounts for the reader’s interpretive abductions and
               potentially aberrant interpretations. The pragmatic focus of semiotic analysis
               following this theory lies in controlling, if not ultimately reducing, indeterminacy
               in communication. The author strives for an ensemble of codes that is the same as
               that of the possible reader, which assumes a particular competency on the reader’s
               part that must come from outside the text itself. Eco develops this into a complex
               model (see <a href="#aubx1qtya2o">fig. 1</a> for a graphic
               presentation) that considers the interpretation of a text and involves intensions
               and extensions, circumstances and content – an ‘intertext’ that refers to endless
               texts and semiotic encoding systems.</p>

            <p id="tcvsa06i1oxg">Drawing on this concept of intertext, I set out to explore how some
               of the intensions underlying Biondo’s text and his rules of co-reference regarding
               the reader’s actualization of the semiotic properties can be taken to identify
               special elements of the text as a means to disambiguate anaphoric and deictic
               expressions. This narrow focus removes some of Eco’s better-known text analysis
               strategies from consideration, for example the narrative strategy, but even in this
               abbreviated form it permits an initial, if tentative, deepening of the interpretive
               process. For this I rely on workshop materials. This is, admittedly, a limitation,
               albeit one that future research working directly with Biondo’s text and materials
               can overcome. I want to acknowledge both the limits and the great importance of
               scholarship for its analysis and synthesis, upon which this article rests. The aim
               of this paper is to be seen in terms of advancing semiotic approaches and related
               methodological concepts to aid researchers considering geographic representations
               in
               text or map form to distinguish different kinds of spatial information in Biondo’s
               text and to identify the textual anchors in this narrative that construct his
               geographical mapping. A broader reading of semiotic approaches from Roland Barthes,
               Karl Bühler, Jacques Derrida, Algirdas Julien Greimas, Charles Sanders Peirce, and
               Roman Jakobson is also a matter for future research. With this special slant, my
               study of Biondo’s <i>Italia Illustrata</i> is conceived as a contribution
               to the development of modern digital tools and approaches with a narrow, and
               limited, theoretical framework.</p>

         <div class="section"><a id="import-lgb7x2sl0b"><!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">Making Territory and Making Geographical Sense</h2>
            <p id="tayubl4u10xr">The matter of writing a textual narrative to describe a geography,
               or, in other words, the process of territory-making, involves a framework of beliefs
               that together constitute an ideology, which, whether as creator (author) or viewer
               (reader) relates us as subjects to these objects of communication. Both author and
               reader have to work to comprehend the objects and make sense of the communication.
               When maps were scarce (as was the case at the time Biondo wrote <i>Italia
                  Illustrata</i> and was definitely no longer the case after technical
               advances in the modern period significantly decreased the cost of printing maps in
               large editions), the text itself had to provide – due to its unfamiliarity and
               uniqueness – much more to support a reader’s interpretative abductions and avoid
               errant interpretations. As contemporary readers today, we struggle to gain the
               philological comprehension and historical contextual knowledge needed to make sense
               of the text’s geographic illustrations. That said, however, the fact that the
               evolution of mapping over the last fifty years has coincided with the development
               of
               digital information technologies, as exemplified by Google Earth, and the rise of
               egocentric versus geocentric approaches to reading geographic representations<a href="#da1vulpsodmg">11</a> makes us acutely aware of the
               transformation of cultures of knowledge and their production. Going from
               institutionalized forms of knowledge and their representations to individual
               experiences and individual knowledge requires making sense of remote sensing images
               posted online and woven together in such a way that is capable of integrating
               various additional geographic representations, with the territory thereby depending
               on the actions of creator and viewer.</p>
            <p id="wivl7l97rbm">The distinction between egocentric and geocentric stems from media
               studies, research in cognitive psychology, and cognitive anthropology. As such, it
               refers to the emphasis on the function of a visual artifact emerging
               <i>through</i> its use by an individual. Egocentric reading extends
               the perspective of a viewer already submersed in the primacy of their subjectivity;
               its anchorage point is the human body itself, with locations, for example, being
               left/right of the body (as Kant highlighted as a universal paradigm). Geocentric
               reading, meanwhile, requires the acquisition of institutionalized and cultural
               knowledge to make sense of the representation, for instance, the conventions of
               topographic mapping (also known in cultures with non-written traditions in which
               natural landmarks serve as spatial anchorage, being, for example, either down- or
               upriver, up- or downhill). Egocentric geovisualization is best exemplified today by
               Google Earth (<a href="#rmp0mhubxq8">fig. 3</a>), which gives the
               person controlling the cursor the unmediated ability to move virtually at different
               degrees of visual detail and connect these visuals to personal experience or
               imagined scenes derived from other media. A topographic map is a vibrant example of
               geocentric geovisualization (as is the case with GeoJSON). Before use, some nominal
               level of understanding of the graphical representations of the map type and scale
               is
               required for a person to move about virtually and connect what they see on the
               screen to their physical experience or imagination. (This is also possible in
               virtual and augmented realities, using a VR headset.)</p>

            <p id="zjovp9rqvo7h">In consideration of professional training (the ability to acquire –
               explicitly or implicitly – knowledge from maps), possessing the faculty to
               understand specific cartographic representations is the gateway to their use in
               academic or scientific expository work. Due to our Western professional
               socialization and socio-cultural education and acculturation, we have different foci
               in our capacities to use contemporary maps or GPS systems, which often makes using
               traditional maps more difficult. Central to this is how a professional creates
               meaning through maps in a way that successfully communicates the institutional
               understanding of territory and significant geographical relations.</p>
            <p id="owed0ha6j6fg">While the technologies available to mapmakers of the fifteenth and
               twenty-first century differ radically, the human processes of making sense of a
               geographic illustration through communication media continue to require
               socialization, education, and acculturation (and the technical prerequisites) for
               map communication to be successful. We need to first understand the creator and
               viewer to then understand how any map can communicate. Eco’s writings, preceded by
               studies in semiology, provide an excellent theoretical framework for considering how
               to take on this challenging deconstruction.</p>

         <div class="section"><a id="import-sfxym49adx"><!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">The Name of the Territory</h2>
            <p id="bpa99xlj5kor">Since the modern era, the effort to understand territory from
               textual or graphical description has become second nature, but that is not to say
               that the effort and coordination involved should not be underestimated. An example
               from literature provides a relevant story. In the semiotician Umberto Eco’s
               well-known fictional work <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, the semantic effort
               to create the text and make sense of it is presented as a medieval detective story
               (see <a href="#thiering2015">(Thiering 2015)</a> for a fuller
               consideration of the novel). The effort of the protagonist illustrates a key aspect
               of Eco’s theorization of the role of the reader and his/her mental models.<a href="#qz5btn56hfk">12</a> The reader, here William of
               Baskerville, must put considerable effort into distinguishing the author’s
               presuppositions and messages from aberrant presuppositions and the actual
               circumstances to make sense of a text and the actions and situations it describes.
               The effort needed to transform an expression into content can be considerable.
               Reading is not merely the simple act of associating meaning correlated to
               expressions. Lexical meaning has to be interpreted in its contextual and
               circumstantial compositions. The reader transforms expressions into content through
               semantic analysis and detection of syntactical properties at the surface level in
               connection to underlying subtexts. Rules of co-reference are central to the
               interpretations. The disambiguation of these co-references requires textual
               operators, such as frames, that communicate the author’s intensions. The reader must
               first get a grasp of tentative co-textual relations. As Øyvind Eide explains, at
               this level, the reader undertakes every transformation from surface to the
               underlying semiotic structure of the single sentences. In cases of ambiguities he
               waits for textual clues.<a href="#sn9s5pftcmhn">13</a></p>
            <p id="t7u4fubq8aca">Through a dialectical process of abduction, the reader develops a
               culturally specific framework through logical inference from observations and learns
               to separate aberrant presuppositions and guard against interpretative failures. S/he
               seeks the simplest and best fitting explanation for the observation without

            <p id="mehbrb2nq14o">In reflections on our experiences explaining maps in a didactical
               context, most of us could readily note the importance of relating subjective
               knowledge and comprehension of geography to its institutionalized representation.
               Crucial to developing this understanding, is an understanding of explicit and
               implicit beliefs, or ideology.<a href="#o3abh8w8ee3k">14</a></p>
            <p id="tikoxbi83dq">The dialectal approach in this semantic methodology relies on
               contradictions to advance its analysis to new insights and the synthesis of
               relations and interactions camouflaged by ambiguous terms and authorial diversions.
               Today we face the challenge of (re)constructing readers’ contextual knowledge and
               ideology arising from their respective socialization, education, and acculturation.
               Taking the example presented by Nathalie Bouloux<a href="#bouloux2022">(2022)</a> in this volume that she uses to explain how
               <i>Italia Illustrata</i> was map-based, the following short excerpt
               provides a range of co-references that facilitate interpretative abductions:</p>
            <div class="blockquote"><a id="d6e241"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="first" id="jzw2wp587nrc">In sinu Lunensis sive Veneris portus intimo Spedia est, novum
                  oppidum ab annis sexaginta muro circumdatum, secus quod, inspecta Italiae
                  descriptione ac pictura a maioribus facta, Tigulliam fuisse coniector.</p>
               <p id="ul5tiwfzfffj">(And in the innermost portion of the bay of the harbor of Luni
                  [or Portovenere] is La Spezia, a new town, walled for not quite sixty years now,
                  near which I surmise, from examining a survey and map of Italy made by
                  forebears, was Tigullia.)<a href="#qv3w7ai5jnn">15</a></p>
            </div>
            <p id="x4eywuuh0ydc">The co-references provide a set of spatial relationships (a portion
               of the bay/harbor of Luni) and position the contemporary town, La Spezia, on the
               site of Tigullia, based on a survey and map. The graphic representation in a map of
               that era (see <a href="#hf28wxup7l2l">fig. 2</a>) corresponds to
               this text. The disambiguation of the geographic relationships is arguably neither
               concise nor precise in both text and map of circa 1467, but both are adequately
               capable of describing the geographic relationships. Without standardization of the
               story for modern readers, the dialectical abduction of the textual representation
               (in translation) is often more cumbersome than the graphic representation, as
               limited Latin knowledge can constitute a substantial challenge for many readers.</p>
            <p id="v462kq64s4r">Another example drawn from Bouloux documents the rich geographical
               descriptions Biondo provides:</p>
            <div class="blockquote"><a id="d6e255"><!-- named anchor --></a><p class="first" id="qz087lvsmtg">After the Auser come first the mouths of the Arno, and a little
                  further on Livorno, a well-fortified stronghold which is the port of Pisa. Here
                  a lighthouse has been set on a reef a mile from the mainland. It provides a
                  light at a great distance to those sailing the Tyrrhenian sea at night and
                  points the way to the harbor of Pisa from afar. Three miles from the sea, Pisa
                  spans the Arno with her bridges and embellishes it with fine buildings. Vergil
                  says that this ancient city with its famous history took its origin from the
                  Alphaei. Pliny tells us that Pisa was founded between the Auser and the Arno by
                  Pelops and the Territani, a Greek people, and Justin that Pisa in Liguria had
                  Greek founders. And Lucan [tells us] in Book I: “On this side, Pisa,
                  interrupting the stretches of the Tyrrhenian sea with her shoal.” Livy in Book
                  XXI [tells us]: “This was why the consul rushed on to the Po after he arrived
                  with his ships at Pisa.”<a href="#fn16">16</a></p>
            </div>
            <p id="yqr3342elyx">Describing the port of Pisa, Biondo offers numerous geographic
               co-references that the reader can dialectically disambiguate to gain a topological
               sense of the spatial relationships, of key phenomena that aided navigation, and of
               the classical information about the site’s history, including documentation of its
               importance and pre-Roman origins. While a metric (“three miles”) is provided, the
               disambiguation is limited by the lack of other metrics and an authorial ambiguity
               (“mouths of the Arno” and “a little further on Livorno”).</p>
            <p id="um0o9ggdgewo">These co-references also point to the challenge discussed earlier
               of understanding these texts with our contextual knowledge of today and lacking a
               more profound understanding of the connotations to guide an interpretation
               reflective of the audience Biondo was writing for. Without a more profound grasp of
               this rich understanding of the circumstances by which Biondo’s readers approached
               his text, our current reading is prone to aberrant interpretations and failures.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="section"><a id="import-i77rcw6x9n"><!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">Relationship between the Illustrator and Illustrated</h2>
            <p id="cplrajfbnfo">Although the dialectical approach offers a means to gain a deeper
               understanding of the explicit and implicit textual elements through dialectical
               abduction of the co-references, consideration of philological scholarship can
               greatly help disambiguate contemporary circumstances and help us to gain insight
               into historical comprehension. In his contribution to this book, Marc Laureys
               provides a description of six concepts of space in Biondo and analyzes the textual
               strategies that allowed Biondo to connect and merge space and history:</p>
            <p id="w0vqhvgiduc2r">Biondo’s conception of space is (1) determined by an ancient, not
               a contemporary (political or ecclesiastical) geographical framework, (2) structured
               into modular units on various geographical (national, regional, and local) levels
               that constantly interact, (3) inspired by cultural and historical rather than
               political or diplomatic claims, (4) visualized by rhetorical means rather than
               empirical evidence, (5) underpinned by references to classical and medieval –
               predominantly literary – sources that serve as a commentary on the localities
               mentioned and described, and (6) are filled with history more than with
               topographical or ethnographical details.<a href="#fn17">17</a></p>
            <p id="jf37nu7ix7b">A more thorough philological engagement would provide a richer
               analysis, but in the context of this chapter’s focus, the quoted passages from
               <i>Italia Illustrata</i> above indeed demonstrate these principles.
               They also point to the importance of a better comprehension of the ambiguities for
               modern readers, the complexities to understand the codes used by Biondo and his
               peers and the ideological biases that prelude contemporary knowledge with classical
               and medieval sources.<a href="#iqwyyhl04qh">18</a> The ambiguity
               of the text may be iteratively lessened by careful philological scholarship.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="section"><a id="import-k998o4my6l"><!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">(Un)certainties</h2>
            <p id="qrxm734hyay">The difficulties in matching classical places to contemporary places
               is a problem of localization and identification, but because of the multiple
               variations in name, location, and geographical relations, resolving the challenges
               can benefit from a dialectical approach, as described above. (Over the course of
               history and charting by different maps, places vanish or swell their borders; the
               Biondo research group at the Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rome use the Recogito
               annotation platform to resolve exactly this problem.) The ambiguities of the text
               can be constructively engaged by a semantic analysis drawing on the intertext
               concepts advanced by Eco and other semioticians. Many of the points regarding
               ambiguity in a text hold the cartographic ambiguity of representing territory today
               inherent in the cartographic gaze. Following David Turnbull’s historiographic
               studies of cartography,<a href="#jcqsiojo125e">19</a> we can grasp
               some potential tensions between a proto-cartographic gaze and experiential knowledge
               crafted to align with classical geography rather than contemporary political or
               ecclesiastical perspectives.</p>
            <p id="gzl0llfc74em">In the context of the philological study, the dialectic approach
               can commence with matters of translation and transcription with can exist among
               various versions of the source text. The analysis of this discursive philology
               identifies the points which are synthesized and studied for their contradictions.
               Beyond the methodological issues of a dialectical approach focused on in this
               chapter, additional triangulation between different translations and the original
               passages and overarching rhetorical and ideological tendencies can help produce a
               synthesis that would advance the understanding of the text based on a richer
               comprehension of contemporary circumstances and ideology.</p>
            <p id="uesm70i3qdb8">The matter remains of the text’s or graphic image’s relationship to
               knowledge and memory – both authorial and of the reader – not just the individual
               but institutional memory, as it relates to the localization of places. Today we tend
               to think of these matters in terms of uncertainties between description – or data
               –
               and the actual phenomena, but this is problematic in that it may reduce the
               relationships to the accuracy of syntactical elements and constrain or even expunge
               considerations of the cultural meanings and associations that guided creator and
               reader in their engagement with the text. Uncertainties today may indeed mask former
               certainties now lost on contemporary readers, but at least an analysis would
               sufficiently point them out and help clarify them.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="section"><a id="import-y7m3usg0mt"><!-- named anchor --></a><h2 class="main-title">Conclusion</h2>
            <p id="axljw4lx6ipi">If we take Eco’s reflections (and related work by other
               semioticians such as Roman Jakobson, Roland Barthes, and Louis Hjelmslev), we find
               ways to engage with the text as a project that is only completed when the reader
               makes sense of it. While the author preparing the text centers on developing a
               strategy and means to communicate sense, for the reader ‘reading’ involves
               developing a strategy to interpret the author’s intention, textual elements, and the
               author’s strategy to make sense of the produced text. In the case of Eco, the
               reader’s strategy involves a complex hermeneutic and dialectical approach to reading
               that focuses on the interpretation of the author’s intentions. With the philological
               research into Biondo’s text, we are in a unique position to engage with the
               historical relationships between text and maps as geographical representations that
               contemporary scholars have largely become blissfully ignorant of, thanks to the
               profusion of maps over the last five centuries. We can certainly better understand
               Biondo by taking up Eco’s approach and engaging our prerogatives and assumptions of
               the cartographic gaze regarding, on the one hand, the relationship between
               geographical texts and graphics and, on the other, the reader’s gaze, by considering
               rules of co-reference and the dialectical abduction from circumstances.</p>
            <p id="d0vfc3ebno3r9">In reconstructing this geography in relationship to contemporary
               place names, a philological study of the original Latin text faces numerous
               challenges. In the scope of this contribution, the reconstruction of known places
               when clear classical, historical, and contemporary toponyms have been identified is
               relevant in considering a more dialectical approach that can connect places with
               toponyms reliably.</p>
            <p id="chmy87blaww9">Approaching uncertainties that arise in Biondo’s text for readers
               today, both due to polysemy and ambiguities, may be a basis for considering
               challenges researchers today face in understanding textual descriptions of
               locations, which remain quite common in the herbarium and other systematized
               classification resources. Here the literature on geocoding holds further relevance
               for the development of robust methods in the digital humanities.<a href="#fn20">20</a> A different geocentric approach to spatialization using
               egocentric elements of geocoding could be easily enhanced. These methods can also
               be
               implemented in a dashboard environment and readily used to complement and evaluate
               philological work in the digital humanities and help support other computation
               approaches.</p>
            <p id="iykxb44uzbn">In closing, I wish to express my gratitude to the other participants
               of the workshop for graciously sharing their workshop materials and their
               discussions to a very early version of this text presented at the workshop. I
               acknowledge a limitation in this contribution due to limited abilities to work
               directly with Biondo’s text and materials. I would also like to acknowledge both the
               limits and great importance of scholarship for its analysis and synthesis upon which
               this contribution rests. The aim of this contribution is to help achieve theoretical
               advancements and methodological concepts to aid researchers. My emphasis here lies
               in helping develop modern digital tools and approaches to distinguish different
               kinds of spatial information in Biondo’s text and to identify the textual anchors
               in
               this narrative that construct his geographical mapping. Connecting historical
               meaning and memory in maps comes with potential benefits and challenges and I feel
               honored to contribute to this field.</p>
