                <p id="rlbphtuedkgq">Contemporary cartography faces numerous challenges to
                    adequately account how a hodological description, here Biondo’s <italic>Italia
                        Illustrata</italic> (1474) could be imagined in the form of a topographical
                    map, based on consistent spatial dimensions, but some challenges call for our
                    attention. After centuries of refinement the topographic map may now provide a
                    cultural representation of geography ubiquitously deployed in the humanities and
                    sciences. It has become even second nature for many fields of science and
                    scholarship, although we should admit we lack full comprehension of maps
                    influence on our understanding. This chapter takes up this matter from the
                    perspective of semiotics and contemporary critical cartography studies related
                    to the comprehending the construction and meaning of territory made through and
                    with maps. Taking what we know from the sociology of science about the ambiguity
                    of knowledge representations, it seems highly relevant to commence by broadening
                    the scope of considerations through semiotics to examine maps’ representations
                    of geographical, cultural memory as institutionalized mnemonic devices that
                    distill complex meanings into symbolic representations. Following Umberto Eco’s
                    model of communication, these stabilize cultural and political associations of
                    places both explicitly and implicitly and sustain themselves through the
                    performances of creating and reading their cartographic presentations. The
                    chapter closes with broader considerations of these challenges and potentials
                    regarding maps analyzed in humanities research that considers the cultural
                    constitution of mappable knowledge.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p id="jyhs52tq13nr">This contribution to the workshop on Flavio Biondo’s <italic>Italia
                    Illustrata</italic> sets out to take up workshop themes – spatial knowledge, its
                contextualization, and spatial representation – and connect them to research in the
                fields of cartography and GIScience. Considering a work created during an early
                phase in the development of modern mapmaking opens fresh perspectives and allows us
                to reconsider assumptions about mapping. As we read the document of Biondo’s
                geographical description, we find ourselves leaving the certitude and exactitude of
                contemporary geoscience representations behind and begin to reflect on explicit as
                well as implicit issues and ideological claims. We are made to consider modernity’s
                so-called ‘cartographic gaze’, which has over the centuries become second nature for
                most makers and users of maps, including in the sciences and humanities. Following
                Kant’s epistemological critique and its methods advanced by semioticians, a semiotic
                study of a geographical text or cartographic presentations is able to probe these
                issues more thoroughly. An ensuing synthesis can consider these issues
                dialectically, as well as the underlying hidden issues that a semiotic approach
                helps reveal.</p>
            <p id="evc60h49fljb">The various matters of geographical description involve
                geographical representation and knowledge and cut to the core of epistemological
                issues of societal power related to maps and meaning. The connection of a narrative
                trope to a particular map also needs to take up scholarly discussions about
                uncertainty and ambiguity in the context of an ideological framing of mapping
                praxis. In this chapter, I will approach these three issues through materials from
                    <italic>Italia Illustrata</italic> presented at the workshop. The grounding
                assertion is that the semiotic analysis that considers historical conditions can
                explain how Biondo’s discourses constitute their validity and their value of truth
                for that era – through the creation of his textual geographic descriptions. Based on
                this critical assessment, we can reconstruct the reception of Biondo’s text as a
                memory device. Finally, we can examine Biondo’s constructions of meaning in light of
                our knowledge of their geographical relevance for his contemporary peers. Our own
                contemporary concerns with uncertainty in geocentric and egocentric mapping,
                especially regarding functionalist and ideological critique modes, can shed light
                Biondo’s socio-political connotations, as well as those of his contemporaries, as
                grounded in ancient geographies, which form the foundation of his illustrations and
                are precursors of modern geography’s striving for representational certitude.<xref

            </p>
            <p id="opejm6zxg5">Given the breadth of the issues and reliance on concepts from
                multiple fields, some terms require preliminary definition.</p>
            <p id="f526qmxndtdp">Maps are resources for graphically communicating complex
                geographical relations. They can be used alone or with other media to develop a
                richer understanding of these relations in terms of regions, places, topography,
                settlements, or other geographically distributed phenomena and to support any
                intervention in the interactions between such phenomena. They are not merely images
                that illustrate, because they rely on specific cultural and institutionalized
                constellations of graphic elements, tropes, and narratives to support the
                communication of geographical relations.</p>
            <p id="nmascazi43ls">The ‘cartographic gaze’ has many meanings. In terms of contemporary
                human geography, it applies to the study of spatial societal and environmental
                relations in the context of their cultural, political, economic, and social
                    significance.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="f4vu2g985sys">2</xref> A concept arising
                in art historical scholarship of the 20th century,<xref ref-type="fn"
                    rid="cs69euh17tz">3</xref> the cartographic gaze relates to concepts of the

                manifest tropes of seeing and controlling the body and its use as metaphor for the
                political entity associated with territory.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="zfwcoxmfkvuu"
                    >5</xref>
            </p>
            <p id="lkepifw1gohf">As far as the construction and reading of maps are concerned, “to
                illustrate” means (beyond the general definitions of the word) to explain, to
                clarify, and to add insight geographically (see also Laureys in this volume). The
                English word derives from the Latin <italic>illustrare</italic>, meaning to add
                light or brightness to something. Biondo’s use of the adjective form in his title
                suggests the importance of selection and highlighting in contrast to a process of
                engaging with the subject, which modern cartographers would wholeheartedly embrace
                while struggling to explain precisely what and how the selection is used
                methodically to elucidate cartographic communication.</p>
            <p id="uqemmqjsmqf">These difficulties go hand in hand with the uncertainty that arises
                from the epistemological separation of knowledge in our minds as distinct from our
                experience in the world. In contemporary science, especially in physical and
                environmental sciences, the concept of uncertainty narrowly articulates possible
                differences between an actual situation and the data recorded to describe that
                    situation.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="bu9xsga5a6g">6</xref> In interdisciplinary
                contexts, uncertainty provides emphasis for different professionally and
                scientifically sound approaches to mediate philosophical and scientific differences
                in specific cultural and institutional contexts involving a creator/writer and a
                    reader.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7">7</xref>
            </p>
            <p id="zxiuasvouhr">In the context of these definitions, the maps known to us can
                perhaps best be understood as the products of a graphic technology to reduce spatial
                ambiguity or provide geographical insights, which corresponds in significant ways –
                despite our visuality – to Biondo’s hodological representations in <italic>Italia
                    Illustrata</italic>. Institutions play a vital part in map production, not just
                by providing funds to support the complex work of creating maps, but also by
                co-developing and facilitating the frameworks required to understand these maps. As
                Alfred Korzybski puts it, the two important characteristics of maps are:</p>
            <disp-quote>
                <p id="oakxonnopepf">A map is not the territory it represents, but if correct, it
                    has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its
                        usefulness.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8">8</xref>
                </p>
            </disp-quote>
            <p id="ttuwzid5d3y">In other words, maps are not linear texts consisting of words and
                grammar or comparable graphic elements, nor, due to their graphic nature and
                cartographical fidelity, can they be reduced to the purely textual. Texts that
                describe geographical places and spaces and maps that visualize geographical places
                and spaces are fundamentally both <italic>models</italic>, finite constructions that
                can be inconsistent, but still useful when drawn or read with a specific purpose or
                purposes in mind.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9">9</xref> In this sense, communication
                with geographical description in either map or textual form involves the creation of
                inferences in one context and the (often broad) interpretation of inferences in
                another context. Creator/author and reader require a level of competency to assure
                that ambiguity of signification in the communication is channeled or minimized. The
                creator generates a strategy, which, following Umberto Eco’s pragmatic approach,
                calls for the reader’s cooperation in making a series of interpretative choices from
                a set of multiple possibilities.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="rgcaieo1qnxo">10</xref> As
                such, generating and attempting communication involve activity on the part of both
                creator and reader.</p>
            <p id="n0iz609somzk6">In his work <italic>A Theory of Semiotics</italic>, Eco examines
                the limits of the widespread contemporary syntactical and linear model of
                communication and proposes a semantic-pragmatic process and hermeneutical approach
                to understanding text that accounts for the reader’s interpretive abductions and
                potentially aberrant interpretations. The pragmatic focus of semiotic analysis
                following this theory lies in controlling, if not ultimately reducing, indeterminacy
                in communication. The author strives for an ensemble of codes that is the same as
                that of the possible reader, which assumes a particular competency on the reader’s
                part that must come from outside the text itself. Eco develops this into a complex
                model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="aubx1qtya2o">fig. 1</xref> for a graphic
                presentation) that considers the interpretation of a text and involves intensions
                and extensions, circumstances and content – an ‘intertext’ that refers to endless
                texts and semiotic encoding systems.</p>

            </fig>
            <p id="tcvsa06i1oxg">Drawing on this concept of intertext, I set out to explore how some
                of the intensions underlying Biondo’s text and his rules of co-reference regarding
                the reader’s actualization of the semiotic properties can be taken to identify
                special elements of the text as a means to disambiguate anaphoric and deictic
                expressions. This narrow focus removes some of Eco’s better-known text analysis
                strategies from consideration, for example the narrative strategy, but even in this
                abbreviated form it permits an initial, if tentative, deepening of the interpretive
                process. For this I rely on workshop materials. This is, admittedly, a limitation,
                albeit one that future research working directly with Biondo’s text and materials
                can overcome. I want to acknowledge both the limits and the great importance of
                scholarship for its analysis and synthesis, upon which this article rests. The aim
                of this paper is to be seen in terms of advancing semiotic approaches and related
                methodological concepts to aid researchers considering geographic representations in

            <title>Making Territory and Making Geographical Sense</title>
            <p id="tayubl4u10xr">The matter of writing a textual narrative to describe a geography,
                or, in other words, the process of territory-making, involves a framework of beliefs
                that together constitute an ideology, which, whether as creator (author) or viewer
                (reader) relates us as subjects to these objects of communication. Both author and
                reader have to work to comprehend the objects and make sense of the communication.
                When maps were scarce (as was the case at the time Biondo wrote <italic>Italia
                    Illustrata</italic> and was definitely no longer the case after technical
                advances in the modern period significantly decreased the cost of printing maps in
                large editions), the text itself had to provide – due to its unfamiliarity and
                uniqueness – much more to support a reader’s interpretative abductions and avoid
                errant interpretations. As contemporary readers today, we struggle to gain the
                philological comprehension and historical contextual knowledge needed to make sense
                of the text’s geographic illustrations. That said, however, the fact that the
                evolution of mapping over the last fifty years has coincided with the development of
                digital information technologies, as exemplified by Google Earth, and the rise of
                egocentric versus geocentric approaches to reading geographic representations<xref
                    ref-type="fn" rid="da1vulpsodmg">11</xref> makes us acutely aware of the
                transformation of cultures of knowledge and their production. Going from
                institutionalized forms of knowledge and their representations to individual
                experiences and individual knowledge requires making sense of remote sensing images
                posted online and woven together in such a way that is capable of integrating
                various additional geographic representations, with the territory thereby depending
                on the actions of creator and viewer.</p>
            <p id="wivl7l97rbm">The distinction between egocentric and geocentric stems from media
                studies, research in cognitive psychology, and cognitive anthropology. As such, it
                refers to the emphasis on the function of a visual artifact emerging
                    <italic>through</italic> its use by an individual. Egocentric reading extends
                the perspective of a viewer already submersed in the primacy of their subjectivity;
                its anchorage point is the human body itself, with locations, for example, being
                left/right of the body (as Kant highlighted as a universal paradigm). Geocentric
                reading, meanwhile, requires the acquisition of institutionalized and cultural
                knowledge to make sense of the representation, for instance, the conventions of
                topographic mapping (also known in cultures with non-written traditions in which
                natural landmarks serve as spatial anchorage, being, for example, either down- or
                upriver, up- or downhill). Egocentric geovisualization is best exemplified today by
                Google Earth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="rmp0mhubxq8">fig. 3</xref>), which gives the
                person controlling the cursor the unmediated ability to move virtually at different
                degrees of visual detail and connect these visuals to personal experience or
                imagined scenes derived from other media. A topographic map is a vibrant example of
                geocentric geovisualization (as is the case with GeoJSON). Before use, some nominal
                level of understanding of the graphical representations of the map type and scale is
                required for a person to move about virtually and connect what they see on the
                screen to their physical experience or imagination. (This is also possible in
                virtual and augmented realities, using a VR headset.)</p>

            <p id="zjovp9rqvo7h">In consideration of professional training (the ability to acquire –
                explicitly or implicitly – knowledge from maps), possessing the faculty to
                understand specific cartographic representations is the gateway to their use in
                academic or scientific expository work. Due to our Western professional
                socialization and socio-cultural education and acculturation, we have different foci
                in our capacities to use contemporary maps or GPS systems, which often makes using
                traditional maps more difficult. Central to this is how a professional creates
                meaning through maps in a way that successfully communicates the institutional
                understanding of territory and significant geographical relations.</p>
            <p id="owed0ha6j6fg">While the technologies available to mapmakers of the fifteenth and
                twenty-first century differ radically, the human processes of making sense of a
                geographic illustration through communication media continue to require
                socialization, education, and acculturation (and the technical prerequisites) for
                map communication to be successful. We need to first understand the creator and
                viewer to then understand how any map can communicate. Eco’s writings, preceded by
                studies in semiology, provide an excellent theoretical framework for considering how
                to take on this challenging deconstruction.</p>

            <title>The Name of the Territory</title>
            <p id="bpa99xlj5kor">Since the modern era, the effort to understand territory from
                textual or graphical description has become second nature, but that is not to say
                that the effort and coordination involved should not be underestimated. An example
                from literature provides a relevant story. In the semiotician Umberto Eco’s
                well-known fictional work <italic>The Name of the Rose</italic>, the semantic effort
                to create the text and make sense of it is presented as a medieval detective story
                (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="thiering2015">(Thiering 2015)</xref> for a fuller
                consideration of the novel). The effort of the protagonist illustrates a key aspect
                of Eco’s theorization of the role of the reader and his/her mental models.<xref
                    ref-type="fn" rid="qz5btn56hfk">12</xref> The reader, here William of
                Baskerville, must put considerable effort into distinguishing the author’s
                presuppositions and messages from aberrant presuppositions and the actual
                circumstances to make sense of a text and the actions and situations it describes.
                The effort needed to transform an expression into content can be considerable.
                Reading is not merely the simple act of associating meaning correlated to
                expressions. Lexical meaning has to be interpreted in its contextual and
                circumstantial compositions. The reader transforms expressions into content through
                semantic analysis and detection of syntactical properties at the surface level in
                connection to underlying subtexts. Rules of co-reference are central to the
                interpretations. The disambiguation of these co-references requires textual
                operators, such as frames, that communicate the author’s intensions. The reader must
                first get a grasp of tentative co-textual relations. As Øyvind Eide explains, at
                this level, the reader undertakes every transformation from surface to the
                underlying semiotic structure of the single sentences. In cases of ambiguities he
                waits for textual clues.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="sn9s5pftcmhn">13</xref>

                context, most of us could readily note the importance of relating subjective
                knowledge and comprehension of geography to its institutionalized representation.
                Crucial to developing this understanding, is an understanding of explicit and

                Today we face the challenge of (re)constructing readers’ contextual knowledge and
                ideology arising from their respective socialization, education, and acculturation.
                Taking the example presented by Nathalie Bouloux<xref ref-type="bibr"
                    rid="bouloux2022">(2022)</xref> in this volume that she uses to explain how
                    <italic>Italia Illustrata</italic> was map-based, the following short excerpt
                provides a range of co-references that facilitate interpretative abductions:</p>
            <disp-quote>
                <p id="jzw2wp587nrc">In sinu Lunensis sive Veneris portus intimo Spedia est, novum

                <p id="ul5tiwfzfffj">(And in the innermost portion of the bay of the harbor of Luni
                    [or Portovenere] is La Spezia, a new town, walled for not quite sixty years now,
                    near which I surmise, from examining a survey and map of Italy made by
                    forebears, was Tigullia.)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="qv3w7ai5jnn">15</xref>

                of the bay/harbor of Luni) and position the contemporary town, La Spezia, on the
                site of Tigullia, based on a survey and map. The graphic representation in a map of
                that era (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="hf28wxup7l2l">fig. 2</xref>) corresponds to
                this text. The disambiguation of the geographic relationships is arguably neither
                concise nor precise in both text and map of circa 1467, but both are adequately
                capable of describing the geographic relationships. Without standardization of the
                story for modern readers, the dialectical abduction of the textual representation
                (in translation) is often more cumbersome than the graphic representation, as
                limited Latin knowledge can constitute a substantial challenge for many readers.</p>
            <p id="v462kq64s4r">Another example drawn from Bouloux documents the rich geographical

            <disp-quote>
                <p id="qz087lvsmtg">After the Auser come first the mouths of the Arno, and a little
                    further on Livorno, a well-fortified stronghold which is the port of Pisa. Here
                    a lighthouse has been set on a reef a mile from the mainland. It provides a
                    light at a great distance to those sailing the Tyrrhenian sea at night and
                    points the way to the harbor of Pisa from afar. Three miles from the sea, Pisa
                    spans the Arno with her bridges and embellishes it with fine buildings. Vergil
                    says that this ancient city with its famous history took its origin from the
                    Alphaei. Pliny tells us that Pisa was founded between the Auser and the Arno by
                    Pelops and the Territani, a Greek people, and Justin that Pisa in Liguria had
                    Greek founders. And Lucan [tells us] in Book I: “On this side, Pisa,
                    interrupting the stretches of the Tyrrhenian sea with her shoal.” Livy in Book
                    XXI [tells us]: “This was why the consul rushed on to the Po after he arrived
                    with his ships at Pisa.”<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16">16</xref>

            <p id="yqr3342elyx">Describing the port of Pisa, Biondo offers numerous geographic
                co-references that the reader can dialectically disambiguate to gain a topological

                the classical information about the site’s history, including documentation of its
                importance and pre-Roman origins. While a metric (“three miles”) is provided, the
                disambiguation is limited by the lack of other metrics and an authorial ambiguity
                (“mouths of the Arno” and “a little further on Livorno”).</p>
            <p id="um0o9ggdgewo">These co-references also point to the challenge discussed earlier

                reflective of the audience Biondo was writing for. Without a more profound grasp of
                this rich understanding of the circumstances by which Biondo’s readers approached

                into historical comprehension. In his contribution to this book, Marc Laureys
                provides a description of six concepts of space in Biondo and analyzes the textual
                strategies that allowed Biondo to connect and merge space and history:</p>
            <p id="w0vqhvgiduc2r">Biondo’s conception of space is (1) determined by an ancient, not
                a contemporary (political or ecclesiastical) geographical framework, (2) structured
                into modular units on various geographical (national, regional, and local) levels
                that constantly interact, (3) inspired by cultural and historical rather than
                political or diplomatic claims, (4) visualized by rhetorical means rather than
                empirical evidence, (5) underpinned by references to classical and medieval –
                predominantly literary – sources that serve as a commentary on the localities
                mentioned and described, and (6) are filled with history more than with

                They also point to the importance of a better comprehension of the ambiguities for
                modern readers, the complexities to understand the codes used by Biondo and his

                is a problem of localization and identification, but because of the multiple
                variations in name, location, and geographical relations, resolving the challenges
                can benefit from a dialectical approach, as described above. (Over the course of
                history and charting by different maps, places vanish or swell their borders; the
                Biondo research group at the Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rome use the Recogito
                annotation platform to resolve exactly this problem.) The ambiguities of the text
                can be constructively engaged by a semantic analysis drawing on the intertext
                concepts advanced by Eco and other semioticians. Many of the points regarding
                ambiguity in a text hold the cartographic ambiguity of representing territory today
                inherent in the cartographic gaze. Following David Turnbull’s historiographic

                identifies the points which are synthesized and studied for their contradictions.
                Beyond the methodological issues of a dialectical approach focused on in this
                chapter, additional triangulation between different translations and the original
                passages and overarching rhetorical and ideological tendencies can help produce a
                synthesis that would advance the understanding of the text based on a richer
                comprehension of contemporary circumstances and ideology.</p>
            <p id="uesm70i3qdb8">The matter remains of the text’s or graphic image’s relationship to
                knowledge and memory – both authorial and of the reader – not just the individual
                but institutional memory, as it relates to the localization of places. Today we tend
                to think of these matters in terms of uncertainties between description – or data –
                and the actual phenomena, but this is problematic in that it may reduce the
                relationships to the accuracy of syntactical elements and constrain or even expunge
                considerations of the cultural meanings and associations that guided creator and
                reader in their engagement with the text. Uncertainties today may indeed mask former
                certainties now lost on contemporary readers, but at least an analysis would
                sufficiently point them out and help clarify them.</p>

            <title>Conclusion</title>
            <p id="axljw4lx6ipi">If we take Eco’s reflections (and related work by other
                semioticians such as Roman Jakobson, Roland Barthes, and Louis Hjelmslev), we find
                ways to engage with the text as a project that is only completed when the reader
                makes sense of it. While the author preparing the text centers on developing a
                strategy and means to communicate sense, for the reader ‘reading’ involves
                developing a strategy to interpret the author’s intention, textual elements, and the
                author’s strategy to make sense of the produced text. In the case of Eco, the
                reader’s strategy involves a complex hermeneutic and dialectical approach to reading
                that focuses on the interpretation of the author’s intentions. With the philological
                research into Biondo’s text, we are in a unique position to engage with the
                historical relationships between text and maps as geographical representations that
                contemporary scholars have largely become blissfully ignorant of, thanks to the
                profusion of maps over the last five centuries. We can certainly better understand
                Biondo by taking up Eco’s approach and engaging our prerogatives and assumptions of
                the cartographic gaze regarding, on the one hand, the relationship between
                geographical texts and graphics and, on the other, the reader’s gaze, by considering
                rules of co-reference and the dialectical abduction from circumstances.</p>
            <p id="d0vfc3ebno3r9">In reconstructing this geography in relationship to contemporary
                place names, a philological study of the original Latin text faces numerous
                challenges. In the scope of this contribution, the reconstruction of known places
                when clear classical, historical, and contemporary toponyms have been identified is
                relevant in considering a more dialectical approach that can connect places with
                toponyms reliably.</p>
            <p id="chmy87blaww9">Approaching uncertainties that arise in Biondo’s text for readers
                today, both due to polysemy and ambiguities, may be a basis for considering
                challenges researchers today face in understanding textual descriptions of
                locations, which remain quite common in the herbarium and other systematized
                classification resources. Here the literature on geocoding holds further relevance
                for the development of robust methods in the digital humanities.<xref ref-type="fn"
                    rid="fn20">20</xref> A different geocentric approach to spatialization using
                egocentric elements of geocoding could be easily enhanced. These methods can also be
                implemented in a dashboard environment and readily used to complement and evaluate
                philological work in the digital humanities and help support other computation
                approaches.</p>
            <p id="iykxb44uzbn">In closing, I wish to express my gratitude to the other participants
                of the workshop for graciously sharing their workshop materials and their
                discussions to a very early version of this text presented at the workshop. I
                acknowledge a limitation in this contribution due to limited abilities to work
                directly with Biondo’s text and materials. I would also like to acknowledge both the
                limits and great importance of scholarship for its analysis and synthesis upon which
                this contribution rests. The aim of this contribution is to help achieve theoretical
                advancements and methodological concepts to aid researchers. My emphasis here lies
                in helping develop modern digital tools and approaches to distinguish different
                kinds of spatial information in Biondo’s text and to identify the textual anchors in
                this narrative that construct his geographical mapping. Connecting historical
                meaning and memory in maps comes with potential benefits and challenges and I feel
                honored to contribute to this field.</p>
