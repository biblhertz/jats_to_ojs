Abstract,"Biondo Flavio's Italia Illustrata is a remarkable work from the
                    15th century that exemplifies the geographical culture of humanism. Commissioned
                    by Alphonse of Aragon, it aims to catalog illustrious figures in Italy but goes
                    beyond by meticulously describing the Italian landscape and celebrating its
                    connection to ancient Rome. This article examines three aspects of
                        : the text's composition, the types of
                    maps mentioned, and their significance in Biondo's work. By analyzing his
                    sources and methods, we gain insights into the humanist's approach to portraying
                    Italy's past and present."
