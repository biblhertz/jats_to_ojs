                    Flavio Biondo wishes to generate in his readers’ minds a more or less complete
                    image of Italy. The present paper aims at elucidating how he does that.
                    Surprisingly, Biondo makes only sporadic use of maps. The line of thought which
                    he expects his readers to envisage, is, in the end, an imagined itinerary: the
                    reader is invited to follow strings of locations along the coasts, rivers,
                    streets etc., without resorting to maps, sketches or other pictorial devices.
                    Ubiquitous measurement data helps in qualifying and enhancing the underlying
                    mental map or script. In this sense, <italic>Italia Illustrata</italic> must be
                    considered a typical work of 'common sense geography' which was the master model
                    for geographical and chorographical descriptions in Antiquity, Middle Ages, and
                    Early modern time.</p>

            <title>1. Describing Italy in <italic>Italia Illustrata</italic>: Some Problems</title>
            <p id="ehpmj1pvzp4a">Flavio Biondo’s project of writing an ‘Italia
                    Illustrata<italic>’</italic> was a huge and daunting task. It started in 1448,
                was cut short in 1453,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref> taken up again over a
                period of several months in 1462, and, sadly, was never brought to the end which
                Biondo originally envisaged. His work was finally published posthumously in 1474 by
                his son Gaspare Biondo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="Blondus.1474">(Biondo
                1474)</xref>. Although – indeed because – Biondo was a thoughtful, experienced, and
                prolific writer, he faced some major challenges and unexpected problems while
                working on his <italic>Italia Illustrata</italic>.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2"
                    >2</xref> He himself points to this in his first chapter:</p>
            <disp-quote>
                <p id="f6zxmyd8zzw7">It is very difficult indeed, amidst such huge changes in the
                    history and topography (as those who have carefully read Roman history realize),
                    to find a means to delimit the regions and to verify the names of their cities,
                    towns, mountains, and rivers in proper fashion.</p>
                <p id="s7pjufxk0o33">(<italic>Est vero perdifficile in tanta mutatione rerum

            <p id="ewuot5uoi6nk">In the following, we analyze and discuss some of the problems
                related to writing a geographical or topographical treatise in premodern times.
                These problems especially concern the availability and usage of Biondo’s sources. In
                approaching the challenge, we pay particular attention to the measurement data which
                figure prominently in Biondo’s text.</p>
            <p id="sje2iyg8wcn">Biondo’s <italic>Italia Illustrata</italic> is, as far as the
                geographical information is concerned, a mixture of different sources and literary
                genres. Biondo has the habit of citing his sources regularly throughout the text.
                They are, first and foremost, literary sources from antiquity. Among them are
                Ptolemy’s <italic>Geography</italic> (clearly in a Latin translation), Strabo’s
                    <italic>Geography</italic> (most probably in Guarino’s then unpublished Latin
                    translation),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">4</xref> Pomponius Mela’s
                    <italic>Chorography</italic>, and – because of the geographical information
                connected with Hannibal’s campaigns in Italy – Livy’s <italic>History of
                    Rome</italic>. Of primary importance for the geographical framework of
                    <italic>Italia Illustrata</italic> are Pliny the Elder’s chapters on Italy in
                his <italic>Natural History</italic> (III.95–131). Biondo cites – and uses – Pliny
                more often than any other geographical author. He even considers Pliny more reliable
                than Ptolemy, the ultimate authority in geographical matters in the fifteenth
                    century.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">5</xref>
            </p>
            <p id="j511btf444ow">But, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i81d9fb6zn6u">Figure 1</xref> and
                    <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ykzxmezmyhvf">Figure 2</xref> below show, Biondo is
                not shy of diverging from his Roman literary model, Pliny. His changes are not only
                ‘updates’ of nomenclature or historical transformation, often involving the
                insertion of modern towns into his text, but also concern traditionally held factual
                truths, like the boundaries of regions or the numbering and ordering of the Italian
                    regions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">6</xref>

            <p id="k7ycqghwplqn">Why does Biondo choose different boundaries to Pliny? And how does
                he do it? A key may be found in 12.1, where Biondo, when starting to describe the
                region of Abruzzo, drastically modifies the traditional boundaries (see <xref
                    ref-type="fig" rid="trbkm0nm3b7i">Figure 3</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7"

                    <title>Superimposition</title>
                    <p>In this sketch the previous two maps are superimposed to emphasize the
                        changes Biondo introduces with his textual mind-map of Latium compared to
                        Pliny’s earlier version (broken lines). Only the Tiber, Biferno, and Sele
                        rivers remain as defining features. The former unity of Latium and Campagna
                        is now divided along the Liris/Garigliano. Pliny’s Samnium is redeployed
                        with regio Latina advancing to the main ridge of the Apennines. Ancient
                        Picenum, once reaching from the River Esino to the River Pescara is nearly
                        cut in half to form newly founded Aprutium between the Tronto and Biferno
                        (14.1: “Having dealt above with the region of the Samnites on the right bank
                        of the River Biferno, I should have passed over to the left bank and started
                        on Puglia”). Finally, Umbria advances from the River Nera to the Aniene,
                        barely three miles from Rome.</p>

            <p id="nfcew24btmmr">Here Biondo writes of the remaining regions to be described
                (Samnium, Campania, Apulia, Lucania, and the territories of the Salentini, Calabri,
                and Bruttii). These seven regions had since been fused into a single entity called
                “the Kingdom” (“<italic>septem hae regiones</italic> in unicam regni appellationem
                sunt confusae”). The political landscape of central and southern Italy had
                drastically changed in the century before Biondo, and therefore so too had the
                organization of the different regions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8">8</xref> In the
                same passage Biondo goes on to say:</p>
            <disp-quote>
                <p id="fkpobqhh1v0p">[...] what and where the enemies of these regions in more
                    ancient times did will be easily gathered from the <italic>Histories</italic> of
                    our ancestors or from my own, and will be easily expounded through the
                    individual descriptions of cities and places, as I have done earlier […]([...]

                        locorumque descriptiones [sicut supra fecimus] edocere</italic>
                    [...]).(14.1)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <p id="z8igc7samq9">Biondo explicitly enumerates the sources he has used in his previous
                chapters. Interestingly, these are <italic>descriptions</italic> – not maps – of
                cities and places.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9">9</xref> Note also that such
                    <italic>descriptiones, </italic>i.e., literary texts, often consisting of simple
                lists of place names, remained popular until the eighteenth century. If one only
                takes into account the literature of the ‘Western’ world, the tradition harkens back
                to the Catalogue of Ships in Homer’s <italic>Iliad </italic>(II.494–759), if not
                earlier. Ancient geographical literature such as Strabo’s
                <italic>Geography</italic>, Pomponius Mela’s <italic>Chorography</italic>, and the
                books on Europe, Asia, and Africa in Pliny’s <italic>Natural History</italic> were
                full of lists and lacked maps, which, after all, were expensive and difficult to
                produce (and reproduce). As modern geographical information systems are mostly
                image-based (atlases, GPS systems, Google Earth, etc.), it is sometimes not easy for
                us to appreciate the importance of such lists and the skill of authors who compiled,
                arranged, and ‘narrated’ seemingly endless lines of place names.</p>
            <p id="m1xaj5csov69">Of course, the lists and borders in Biondo’s sources needed to be
                updated and organized according to contemporary (i.e., fifteenth century)
                administrative and ecclesiastical domains. How exactly Biondo approached this kind
                of updating remains unclear. He almost exclusively quotes authors from Greco-Roman
                and early medieval times. That he indeed makes use of very few contemporary sources
                can be gleaned from a passage in the <italic>Additiones correctionesque Italiae
                    illustratae</italic>. In this passage, Biondo claims that he has prefaced the
                original version of his <italic>Italia Illustrata</italic> with a catalogue of the
                authors of his time. It was later deleted by the “perfidious bishop” (Francesco
                Conduler?) who brought his work – prematurely – to light <italic>(“viros aetatis
                    nostrae in catalogum principio promissum multis in operis urbibus et oppidis a
                    me positos”</italic>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="swo0nt9ixr6">10</xref> As such a
                catalogue has not come down to us, we can only speculate about the quantity and
                quality of contemporary authors. Occasionally, Biondo mentions modern historical and
                regional studies (for example, Leonardo Bruni’s <italic>History of the Florentine
                    People)</italic> which was surely important for his own chapter on Etruria
                (Tuscany) in the <italic>Italia Illustrata</italic>. It is difficult to make an
                educated guess as to the extent of use of contemporary sources. This is especially
                true for the source material outside the humanist canon of exemplary authors: travel
                reports, archival material, administrative documents, oral sources,<xref
                    ref-type="fn" rid="fn11">11</xref> and – perhaps – regional maps may have been
                used by Biondo. But, again, this falls into the realm of speculation.<xref

            <title>2. Describing Italy without Maps</title>
            <p id="fm4566ns73u">Despite the huge differences between the regions of Italy in terms
                of morphology, culture, and history, Biondo constructs and narrates spaces
                throughout his work in a rather stereotypical fashion. Of primary importance are the
                waterways. The larger regions in Italy are mostly shaped by the coastlines and by
                the rivers emptying into the sea. Quite often, rivers subdivide these larger regions
                into smaller units, thus also structuring the interior of the country.</p>
            <p id="uk1kxq459kws">The Puglia chapter at the end of Biondo’s work illustrates his
                method. It consists of only eight paragraphs but contains no less than 57
                    toponyms<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13">13</xref> and 23 distance specifications.
                As we may be dealing here with a section of <italic>Italia Illustrata</italic> that
                has to a large extent remained a fragment, it is best suited to study Biondo’s
                methodology. At the very beginning<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14">14</xref> we find
                an explanation for his approach:</p>
            <disp-quote>
                <p id="czvasepu6g5l">Having dealt above with the region of the Samnites on the right

                    we could have passed over to the left bank of the river and started there with
                    Puglia; but we were obliged to describe Campania first, because Campania is
                        connected<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15">15</xref> with Samnium (as was shown
                    before). But with Campania completed, we therefore must go back [to
                        Puglia].(<italic>Oportuit supra Samnitium regione ad Tiferni amnis dexteram

            </disp-quote>
            <p id="hug2kudkbbyc">Here Biondo explains why he feels the urge to abandon the ‘natural’
                course of his narrative. And here, as elsewhere,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16"
                    >16</xref> we see Biondo prioritizing historical considerations over
                geographical ones. In the following, Biondo, like a virtual ship captain, cruises
                along the Adriatic coastline of Puglia to the mouth of the first river, Tifernus
                (Biforno), which he follows upstream. In the beginning, he only names the places
                lying on the one side (the right-hand side) of the river. The distances between the
                locations are indicated in miles, whenever they are known to him. Having arrived at
                the source of the river, Biondo does not ‘sail back’, now describing the locations
                on the other (left-hand) side of the river, but instead starts his voyage anew at
                the mouth of the River Tifernus.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17">17</xref> This
                ‘redeployment’ was probably induced by his source material. Having again reached the
                source of the river, Biondo now turns to the second Apulian river, the
                Fortorius/Fortore, the mouth of which is claimed to be twenty miles from that of the
                River Tifernus “along the coast [<italic>viginti milia passuum in litore
                    distat</italic>]” (14.4). And once again, the virtual cruising along the river
                enables Biondo to enumerate the towns, castles, lakes, etc. in the interior of
                Puglia. This kind of narrative – which is reminiscent, <italic>mutatis
                    mutandis</italic>, of a string of pearls or rosary – is both simple and
                effective.</p>
            <p id="u1bt7pkils4l">Again, it harkens back to ancient times, when geographical authors
                like Strabo and Pliny employed it on a regular basis to describe regions and spaces
                without resorting to a map (arguably resorting instead to a cognitive map). We may
                call Biondo’s method ‘hodological’ (from the Greek <italic>hodós,</italic> for road,
                path, way),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18">18</xref> as the reader is left without a
                bird’s-eye view, i.e., without a cartographic perspective of the region, and has
                instead only the ‘street view’ of someone traveling virtually along a road or
                coastline (or any other route).</p>
            <p id="g48rv59h8f8n">Sticking to such a ‘one-dimensional’ view has certain consequences.
                For one, the transmitted distances between two locations are rarely meant as linear
                distances, but as routes along roads or coastlines, which deviate more or less from
                any lines that may be drawn ‘as the crow flies’.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19"
                    >19</xref> Such distances, regularly expressed in miles (or rather, in steps, as
                a mile is defined as 1000 steps: <italic>mille passuum</italic>), are contingent to
                many factors, among them the length of the stride, the morphology of the terrain,
                the condition of roads, the currents of the waterways, the possible existence of
                barriers and obstacles, etc. In fact, in premodern times, when there was no
                practical means to measure distances between towns, distances were either calculated
                or rather counted in steps or recalculated based on the amount of time (normally in
                hours) spent walking or sailing. It goes without saying that distances in this
                ‘hodological’ system provide a relatively good estimation of the time required for a
                journey between any two points, but are difficult to use and adapt for a
                cartographical or geographical representation of space. In other words, depending on
                the context, distances can be of either a more ‘practical’ or more ‘theoretical’
                nature.</p>
            <p id="ptc8pm0v4h8m">Biondo is obviously aware of this intrinsic problem. For him,
                distances are neither geometrical lines nor simple roads. Therefore, every once in a
                while, he adds some qualification to his measurement data, as the following in his
                Aprutium (Abruzzo) chapter (14.54): “[…] these places are ten miles from Beneventum
                (at the points where the crossing of the rivers is possible) [<italic>absunt haec
                    loca a Benevento (fluviis ubi expedit transmissis) decimo </italic>[sc.
                    miliario]]<italic>”.</italic>
                <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20">20</xref>
            </p>
            <p id="vl87p6psm95q">While the number of distances transmitted by Biondo is impressive
                in itself, he is also interested in the <italic>quality</italic> of the data. As
                Biondo often cites the sources of the measurement data – in nearly all instances
                works from Greco-Roman antiquity – this underlines his broad reading and diligent
                extraction from sources.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21">21</xref> Apparently, he pays
                much attention to distances throughout his work, which eventually resulted in a
                considerable amount of metrological information. Sometimes, he even makes an
                explicit effort to evaluate his data by refining his numbers with certain qualifiers
                like “plus/minus” (3.8). To his mind, informing the readers about the exact
                distances is an integral part of his endeavor. But distances are rarely simple
                elements of geographical information. Distances are very important for conveying a
                    <italic>sense</italic> of spatiality.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22">22</xref> By
                using words and numbers, Biondo evokes mental images not only of the absolute and
                relative location of places, but also of the intervals between them and thus of the
                position, shape, and size of the regions described in <italic>Italia

                region (for example, Alexandria in Egypt, or Verona, which is mentioned in the
                Liguria chapter: “a Plinio Veronense”), variants of names, subcategories (for
                example, a church within a settlement or town), anonymous towns, and – quite often –
                mountains and rivers. Mountains and rivers are included, however, whenever Biondo
                indicates a specific ‘landmark’ in association with them, such as the source or
                mouth of a river, or a part of a mountain, island, or coast. In other words, we have
                taken “toponym” to mean “point in the landscape”. The sixth column states the number
                of distances in the chapter.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29">29</xref> Distances are
                defined here as the “extension of space between two points on a measured course”.
                The “extension” is usually expressed in a specific unit of measurement and defined
                by a certain quantity. “The distance from A to B is x miles” is an example of the
                standard phrasing used in Biondo’s <italic>Italia Illustrata</italic>. In most
                cases, Biondo’s mile is the traditional Roman mile, equaling, roughly,<xref
                    ref-type="fn" rid="fn30">30</xref> 1.5 kilometers. This can be inferred from
                passages when Biondo feels compelled to make a conversion to the ‘modern’ mile<xref
                    ref-type="fn" rid="fn31">31</xref> or adds a qualification to his numerical

                    >32</xref> That said, however, he also uses other units of measurement, like

                Italy.</p>
            <p id="sgqmrpmkxvt">In all, we find 297 distance specifications in the <italic>Italia

                sake of comparison: Strabo’s <italic>Geography</italic>, which lends itself to
                comparison with <italic>Italia Illustrata</italic> in scope and form, has an average
                of 77 measurements of distance per country (or more exactly, 65 for the northern
                part of Italy and 94 for the southern), which in turn equates to a ratio of 211
                words of description for every numerical distance.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38"
                    >38</xref> This means that Biondo conveys less than half the measured distances
                that Strabo gives over the same amount of words. Even if we do account for
                differences in language, historical period, and topic, the discrepancy is
                nevertheless remarkable. To our mind, it cannot be explained merely by the
                difference in availability of source material. In fact, the most comprehensive

                <p id="azf8x76espi">But in the inland areas there were many cities and almost
                    numberless towns and castles, of which, according to Pliny, fifty-three peoples
                    have perished without trace. In describing this inland region, we shall not be
                    able to adhere to the method which we have used in other [regions] – starting
                    with the mouths, sources, and courses of the rivers. But we shall adopt another,
                    which will meet our needs better and which cannot be applied to other regions of
                    Italy: by proceeding along the three roads – <italic>Appia</italic>,

                    of digressing and going astray (inevitably so, since the roads have sometimes
                    deviated from their route), when bridges have been ruined, sometimes because
                    they have since been completely destroyed and are completely unknown as a

            <p id="b4j3acw23bw">Interestingly, Biondo does not inform his readers that he has
                inherited the “new method” of presenting locations “on”, “near”, and “between” from
                the Greek geographer Strabo. In Book V of <italic>Geography</italic>, Strabo, an
                ardent admirer of Roman craftmanship, writes as follows:</p>
            <disp-quote>
                <p id="rzgd6e4ib1sr">As for the rest of the cities of Latium, their position may be

                    best-known roads that have been constructed through Latium; for they are
                    situated either on these roads, or near them, or between them. The best known of
                    the roads are the Via Appia, the Via Latina, and the Via Valeria […].(V.3.9, C

            <p id="k5o504uiw6rr">Why does Biondo choose to pass over this fact in silence, given his
                fondness of citing Strabo as his main authority throughout the Latium chapter?</p>
            <p id="zifgp2itxdoc">In 3.19, after “narrating” the coastline of Latium until Sinuessa
                and some settlements along the River Liris, Biondo claims that he can longer use the
                “traditional method”, “Ariadne’s thread”, as employed in his description of the
                previous regions (i.e., using the rivers from their mouth and heading upstream as
                his ‘unspooling’ guide in describing the inland regions). Instead he declares his
                intention of following the three <italic>viae</italic>
                <italic>Appia, Latina, and Tiburtina,</italic> which lead to the River Liris and the
                towns of Sinuessa and Caieta.</p>
            <p id="ds0nkulqngp8">As one may guess from the titular endpoints of these three roads
                (which are in fact rivers!), Biondo, like his predecessor Strabo, is unwilling to
                entirely give up his proven ‘river method’. For example, in 3.33, when describing
                locations along the <italic>Via Tiburtina</italic>, he writes as follows: “To the
                left of the River Aniene in these mountains is first a town called Vicovaro […].
                Higher up are the little towns of Portella and Cantalupo. Then there is Riofreddo on
                a steep hill […] <italic>etc</italic>.” Obviously, even the “new method” was unable
                to solve every problem.</p>
            <p id="m6xzmbs3d19">The three ‘surrogate rivers’ (i.e., the ancient roads first skirting
                the Pontine Marches [<italic>Via Appia</italic>], then following the River Sacco
                    [<italic>Via Latina</italic>], before heading eastwards [<italic>Via
                    Tiburtina</italic>]) were separated by the western Monti Lepini and the eastern
                Monti Ernici respectively.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50">50</xref> In the case of
                the central valley, the route taken was the <italic>Via Lavicana</italic> of the
                    <italic>Itinerarium Antonini</italic>, but in other documents and in other times
                or sections it was variously known as the <italic>Via Latina</italic> or <italic>Via
                    Casilina</italic>. East of the Monti Ernici, Biondo follows the <italic>Via
                    Tiburtina</italic> which changes its name beyond Tivoli/Tibur to <italic>Via
                    Valeria</italic> and still further east in the vicinity of Lake Fucino to
                    <italic>Via Claudia Valeria</italic>. Biondo is perfectly clear by saying that
                he is unable to follow these ancient roads, due to their general disintegration and
                changes to the landscape since ancient times. In fact, in Biondo’s time, the
                    <italic>Via Appia</italic> was replaced by an <italic>Appia

                foothills dominating the valley and following the ancient road at a distance of
                roughly eight kilometers. The wrong sequence between Acutum (modern-day Acuto) and
                Trivilianum (modern-day Véroli) is difficult to explain. It may be a simple

            <p id="t4ebdips1c6b">The sequence of towns and settlements does not follow the ancient
                road nor the shoreline and seems unlikely to have been read off a map. Perhaps it is
                ordered into three localized sub-clusters: the first lies to the northwest of the
                lake (San Potito–Magliano), the second is connected to the eastern part of the lake
                (Celano–Venere), and the third would be the three settlements marking the outer
                limits of Latium (Goriano Sicoli–Vittorito). Note that these last three towns are
                beyond the watershed on the Adriatic side of the Apennines range.</p>
            <p id="zn5fusd40grd">Another statement by Biondo adds to the confusion. In 3.38 he
                informs his readers that he “has left out some <italic>castella</italic> and
                    <italic>oppida</italic> […] which do not lie in the vicinity of the three roads
                mentioned above [<italic>omissa vero sunt a nobis superius nulli praedictarum trium
                    viarum propinqua aliquot castella et oppida</italic>].” What a bewildering
                statement! Effectively, Biondo admits here that he has deliberately chosen to ignore
                geographical information which does not fit in to his preconceived authorial
                framework. He nevertheless then mentions Rhoca Cavarum, “lying between Palestrina
                and Tivoli as well as Vicovaro and Gennezauno [<italic>Praeneste Tiburque inter et
                    Vicum Varronis ac Zinazanum sita</italic>]” as the origin of the “Capranica”.
                After an <italic>elogium</italic> on the noble ancestry of this family, he then
                spouts the names of another eighteen settlements, whose location remains unclear as
                Biondo merely uses the adverbial expressions <italic>deinceps</italic>, <italic>his
                    proxima</italic>, <italic>post, propinquum</italic>, without, however, bothering
                to state the directions (a common circumstance in the <italic>Italia
                    Illustrata</italic>, which has very few indications of compass roses or
                winds).</p>
            <p id="l5suwhrv8x2t">None of the clusters describes the modern sites along the ancient
                roads, rather they broadly follow their path through the foothills in Latium. The
                structure of the sequence of settlements suggests Biondo was drawing from a mixture
                of literary records, maps, and personal experience as possible sources. Family
                estates (after all, Biondo was apostolic secretary to Pope Eugene IV and the next
                two popes) do not seem to play a role. Indeed, the many <italic>Baroni di
                    Roma</italic>, including the papal administration of Campania et Maritima,
                presided over estates in Latium that were exceedingly scattered – territorially and
                temporally.</p>
            <p id="ql5t7dvgczyl">The number of cluster names – 36 – compared to a total of 143
                toponyms shows, on the one hand, that Biondo resorts to this means in presenting
                geographical information at his disposal (and, moreover, feels at liberty to leave
                it out, if inconvenient). On the other hand, however, it does not support, at least
                not in the case of Latium, Ottavio Clavuot’s exaggerated claim that on average 65
                percent of them are to be found in textual conglomerations of such kind.</p>
            <p id="ifssv66chq8">Interestingly, Biondo makes no mention anywhere of maps for the
                Latium chapter. In fact, our discussion of the distances suggests that Biondo has
                neither a map of Latium nor an itinerary with all the distances. He seems not even
                to have had access to a ‘road map’ containing distances for points along the
                    <italic>Via Latina</italic>. </p>
            <p id="zebz275gre7">On a final note: despite the fact that Biondo cites Strabo
                throughout the Latium chapter more often than any other source, we nevertheless can
                state that the Greek geographer played only a limited, if not marginal role. It is
                true, Biondo loves to quote Strabo, especially for distances and information
                otherwise unknown, but he clearly does not adopt his structure or narrative
                accordingly. These were already defined <italic>before</italic> his acquaintance
                with Strabo. And even his novel idea of illustrating Latium, not by rivers but by
                roads – an idea which does indeed date back to Strabo – is not really carried
                out.</p>

            <title>Conclusion</title>
            <p id="kbtrgq2fl8o">As we have seen, Biondo’s <italic>Italia Illustrata</italic> makes
                (at best) sporadic use of maps; neither does Biondo require it of readers to use a
                map alongside his text. Following <italic>le tre corone</italic> of the fourteenth
                century, Biondo wishes to generate in his readers’ minds a more or less complete
                image of Italy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="mz7yc1jdpzws">56</xref> The line of thought
                which Biondo expects his readers to follow, is, in the end, an
                    <italic>imagined</italic> itinerary, based on a mental map or cognitive script.
                For this purpose, he does not feel the need to rely on a map (certainly not for his
                description of Latium, although he uses or claims to have used them for other
                regions), and instead employs the dominant master-model of premodern times, the
                hodological view. Those rare passages where he does employ a bird’s eye view change
                neither his basic approach to topography nor the fundamental construction principle
                of his narrative.</p>
            <p id="hlioxhu42xe">Common sense geography in the broadest sense is concerned with a
                premodern ‘geometric’ model of reality which is intuitive and therefore
                non-mathematical. It works surprisingly well with approximated directions and
                distances because it can ‘crystalize’ into real locations and meeting places (like
                Stonehenge, for example) by way of a sequence of remembered and memorized
                landmarks.</p>
            <p id="bqjrxpvacrek">Seen like this, a river or a road is a reassuring sequence of
                landmarks leading to sites of reverence (like Rome or Jerusalem) as well as being of
                military or mercantile nature. In this sense, Biondo appears to stand at the turning
                point in history, solidly anchored in traditional and proven usage while collecting
                the proud but non-mathematical heritage of the past. The future lies ahead of him –
                already in sight, but still vague and fuzzy: Ptolemy’s purely mathematical model,
                rendering the surface of the earth to scale and defining its respective elements in
                pairs of geodesic coordinates (i.e., longitudes and latitudes). In the absence of
                sufficiently precise instruments and methods to properly locate the landmarks in
                mathematical terms, this task would eventually take several centuries to
                complete.</p>

                <p>See 12.36: “Ptolemy lists Ortona, along with the mouth of the Aterno, as being in
                    Paelignian territory. But Pliny (who when it comes to Italian matters is in my
                    view more trustworthy) assigned the whole stretch from the mouth of the Aterno
                    to the territory of Larino to the land of the Frentani. Not only that, but
                    Ptolemy himself puts the city of Frentana to the left of the Aterno, where
                    Francavilla now is, as Pliny does too, so that I am quite sure that either
                    Ptolemy’s map was distorted [<italic>ut aut Ptolemaei picturam esse
                        depravatam</italic>], since it is self-contradictory, or his informants were
                    in error.”</p>

                <p>In 1.7 Biondo claims that Iginius (elsewhere “Hyginus”, i.e., the ‘Ravenna
                    Cosmographer’) and Guido of Pisa knew of 700 towns in Italy see (<xref
                        ref-type="bibr" rid="Parthey.1860">(Parthey/Pinder 1860,
                        249.15-287.17)</xref>) but Biondo, who follows the <italic>Romanae ecclesiae
                        stilum</italic> (i.e., <italic>loca quae episcopos habent</italic>), counts
                    only 264, ignoring 40 <italic>civitates</italic>, which now belong to other
                        <italic>dioeceses</italic>. Biondo concludes from these numbers that since
                    the time of Guido (which was, according to his statement in 1.8, around 600
                    years ago), 396 towns or settlements had been destroyed or abandoned. He adds
                    his personal observation that more than 30 <italic>civitates et oppida</italic>
                    were razed to the ground in his own lifetime. That Biondo cites a number of 700
                    towns is puzzling. In the standard edition of the <italic>Ravenna
                        Cosmography</italic> we find 492 entries. Subtracting the number of
                    duplications in the text and adding the additional toponyms from Guido’s
                    periplus in Book V of his <italic>Geographia</italic>, we arrive at
                    approximately 450 towns at the very most. This huge discrepancy is difficult to
                    explain. As the first edition was only published by David Placidus Porcheron in
                    1688, Biondo may have had access to more or different manuscripts than the
                    surviving three (now in Paris, Basel, and the Vatican).</p>

                <p>In this sketch the previous two maps are superimposed to emphasize the changes
                    Biondo introduces with his textual mind-map of Latium compared to Pliny’s
                    earlier version (broken lines). Only the Tiber, Biferno, and Sele rivers remain
                    as defining features. The former unity of Latium and Campagna is now divided
                    along the Liris/Garigliano. Pliny’s Samnium is redeployed with regio Latina
                    advancing to the main ridge of the Apennines. Ancient Picenum, once reaching
                    from the River Esino to the River Pescara is nearly cut in half to form newly
                    founded Aprutium between the Tronto and Biferno (14.1: “Having dealt above with
                    the region of the Samnites on the right bank of the River Biferno, I should have
                    passed over to the left bank and started on Puglia”). Finally, Umbria advances
                    from the River Nera to the Aniene, barely three miles from Rome.</p>

                    Our modern convention of looking downstream was only instituted in Germany in

                    structures and to connect the various elements of this scheme. With the help of
                    measurement data it is even possible to define the size and distances of these
                    elements and thus make them well-structured and reproducible for others.</p>

                <p>Very rarely, Biondo gives linear distances, qualified as being “on a straight
                    line, directly [recto itinere instituto]”, for example, in 3.21, between
                    Velitrae and Sarmineta. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="Biondo.2005b">(Biondo
                        2005, 110)</xref>, White translates the passage concerning the distance
                    between Viterbo and Valeria as: “six miles […] as the crow flies […].” But this
                    is not in the Latin text and contradicts Biondo’s geographical vocabulary, with
                    ad sextum lapidem (“at the sixth milestone”) being reserved for distances along
                    roads. In modern literature, such deviations are often exaggerated. In a few
                    cases they may even yield multiples of the linear distances and contribute to
                    some geographical confusion and misconceptions in geographical literature. On
                    the contrary, as our database on measurement data shows, on average, such
                    deviations are approximately 30 percent off. Ingeniously, Ptolemy in his
                    Geography (I.12.3; cf. I.13.2) gives the practical advice of shortening such
                    distances by a third in order to arrive at the linear distance.</p>

                    prominent town in the region [of Umbria].” The ‘proximity’ of a place – in this
                    case between Interamnia/Terni and Sanctus Geminus/San Gemini – is clearly not
                    measured in terms of distance (which here is approximately twelve kilometers or
                    eight miles), but by the accessibility of a place, which was apparently
                    obstructed by the flow of the river. Both modern Terni and San Gemini are
                    located north of the Nera but the ancient name of Interamnia (literally,
                    “between the rivers”) shows that Terni was thought to lie to the south of the

                <p>From regio 8 (Venetiae) through to regio 11 (Histria), attributing toponyms is
                    complicated by the fact that Biondo states in regio 8.2 that: “the region of the
                    duchy is 80 miles long from Aquae Gradatae/San Canzian to Lauretum/Loreo […] and
                    variable in breadth (habet autem eius ducatus regio longitudinem milium
                    octoginta, ab Aquis olim Gradatis […] Latitudo autem varia).” The problem arises
                    from the fact that San Canzian is east of the Isonzo and some coastal towns
                    belong to Venice but are again listed as being in either regio 9 or regio 10.
                    Here we have chosen all names mentioned in regio 8 south of the swamp line, as
                    compared to places mentioned in regio 9 and regio 10. The sole remaining

                    expressions of such kind in Biondo than in ancient authors like Strabo and
                    Pliny. The scope of this paper prevents us from discussing this interesting
                    element of common sense geography.</p>

                <p>In 7.4, Biondo quotes among his sources the Itinerarium Antonini, but makes no
                    use of it for the many distances it offers for Lombardy. In 12.55, Biondo
                    writes: “Nam Antoninus Pius in Itinerario viam describens a Benevento ad
                    Columnas, ad Mercurialem primum, post ad Matrem Magnam posuit.” Neither the
                    plural “ad Columnas” nor the site of Mercurialis are mentioned in the
                    Itinerarium Antonini. Is Biondo perhaps playing here with the homonymy of
                    Columna in order to flatter his patron Colonna?</p>

                <p>On the coastline of Latium, Pliny (NH III.56) says: “[formerly] from Ostia to
                    Circei 50 miles”. The Tabula Peutingeriana has it as 70 miles; the geodesic
                    would be 87 kilometers or 1.74 kilometers/mile for Pliny and 1.24
                    kilometers/mile for the Tabula Peutingneriana (which equates to a 16 percent
                    discrepancy, which is reasonable). Pliny then goes on to state “from whence the
                    name Latium reached as far as the River Liris”, before listing several points
                    along the coast, starting with Ostia, the town of Laurentum, the sacred grove of
                    Jupiter Indiges, the River Numicius and Ardea, the former site of Aphrodisium,
                    the colony of Antium, the river and island of Astura, the River Nymphaeus, the
                    Clostra Romana, Circeii (formerly an island), the River Ufens, the city of
                    Terracina (“called in the language of the Volsci ‘Anxur’”), Amyclae, a cave,
                    Lake Fundanus, the port of Caieta, the town of Formiae (formerly Hormiae), the
                    town of Pyrae, the colony of Minturnae, through which the River Liris flows
                    (also known as the Glanis), and the town of Sinuessa – the last point of the new
                    Latii (NH III.56–60). We do not claim that Biondo is citing Pliny here, but it
                    is useful to compare the distances with those Biondo read elsewhere. This also
                    highlights the reliability of ancient sources in the area. At the very least,
                    such a literary comparison gives us a sense of the ‘variability’ in the length
                    of a mile, as compared to those which Biondo reports.</p>

                <p>It is obvious that – even in the vicinity of Rome – the requirements of a system
                    of local roads were in medieval times quite different to those of antiquity.
                    This essay merely contains a collection of known distances from various epochs,
                    with the focus (unfortunately) lying predominantly on ancient sources.
                    Throughout, our kilometric distances are geodesic shortest paths. An effort was
                    made to retrace medieval pilgrim and trade routes using visible roads on the
                    ground. Evidently, many of these roads have since been subsumed by modern
                    construction, especially in the heavily urbanized centers of Rome, Naples, and
                    the cities in Lombardy. However, none of these ‘modern’ (i.e., fifteenth
                    century) routes are available in Latium (the only exception being the former Via
                    Flaminia).</p>

                <p>Most toponyms in Biondo’s Latium do not follow classical roads or urban sites but
                    trace out hilltop settlements. This is unsurprising in the context of historical
                    evolution after the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Climate change and the
                    breakdown of infrastructure such as roads and engineering (drainage, Pontine
                    Marshes) made fertile valleys unsafe for habitation. Later, Arab raids increased
                    the necessity to ‘take to the hills’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="Purton.2010"
                        >(see Purton 2010, 99)</xref>). Subsequent marauding French (Angevin),
                    German (Suebian), and Spanish (Aragonese) soldiery sustained the pressure and
                    reinforced the transition to the medieval feudal system, in which protection,
                    control, and exploitation of the population at large emanated from these
                    predominantly hilltop installations. Regional variants arose and are subject to
                    intense archaeological study with findings that are still ongoing.</p>

                <p>Biondo writes: A-T-C-F-V-F. A more realistic itinerary would read A-F-T-C-V-F.
                    Single line switches do occur occasionally in manuscript copies of records. But
                    the above sequence requires a double line switch: Biondo (or the scribe he
                    consulted) had to amend the omission of Fiuggi two lines later, which is
                    rare.</p>
